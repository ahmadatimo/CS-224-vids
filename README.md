# CS-224-vids
 bunch of videos i made to make it easier for students to prepare for CS224

# how to download: 
  there will be lesson (number).zip and this what u should be extracting to get the videos 
  but u must download the other files that are lesson (number).z(number) in order for the extraction step to work. 
  once u press on a file u will be directed to the page and there will be *view raw* button press it and the download will start immediately. 

  # notes: 
  I am not thinking about explaining single cycle, pipline, cahce memory, virtual memory. 
  I just make videos about what I find myself capable of explaining.

  peace be upon you & good luck.
